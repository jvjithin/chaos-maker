All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-26

### Added

- **Service Worker chaos (Phase 1 of v0.4.0)**: chaos rules now apply to fetches issued from a service worker. New subpath export `@chaos-maker/core/sw` ships dual ESM (`sw.mjs`) + IIFE (`sw.js`) bundles excluding Zod, the UI assailant, and the builder. Users add one line to their service worker (`importScripts('/path/to/chaos-maker-sw.js')` for classic SWs, or `import { installChaosSW } from '@chaos-maker/core/sw'` for module SWs). New shared `SW_BRIDGE_SOURCE` constant + `injectSWChaos`, `removeSWChaos`, `getSWChaosLog`, and `getSWChaosLogFromSW` helpers in all 4 adapters. Auto-reapply on `controllerchange` so SW updates inherit config.
- **SSE / EventSource chaos (Phase 2 of v0.4.0)**: new `sse` config block on `ChaosConfig` with `drops`, `delays`, `corruptions`, and `closes`. Mirrors the WebSocket interceptor's wrapper-constructor approach to patch `globalThis.EventSource` — intercepts inbound `MessageEvent`s, supports per-rule `urlPattern`, `eventType` (named events or `'*'` wildcard), `probability`, `onNth`/`everyNth`/`afterN`, and the four standard corruption strategies (`truncate`, `malformed-json`, `empty`, `wrong-type`). New events `sse:drop`, `sse:delay`, `sse:corrupt`, `sse:close`. Builder shortcuts `dropSSE`, `delaySSE`, `corruptSSE`, `closeSSE`. New `unreliableEventStream` preset (5% drops + 200ms delay + 2% close-after-2s). Wildcard rules auto-attach a chaos listener whenever the app subscribes to a new named event type. SSE types re-exported from all 4 adapters; new E2E coverage on Playwright (chromium+firefox+webkit+edge), Cypress (chrome+electron), and Puppeteer.
- **GraphQL operation-name matching (Phase 3 of v0.4.0)**: every network rule (failures, latencies, aborts, corruptions, cors) now accepts an optional `graphqlOperation: string | RegExp` field. Acts as an AND filter on top of `urlPattern` + `methods` — a rule with `graphqlOperation: 'GetUser'` only fires for that operation, leaving every other operation on the same `/graphql` URL untouched. Detection covers both POST + JSON body (operation read from `operationName` field, then fallback to parsing `query GetUser { … }`) and persisted-query GET requests (`?operationName=` / `?query=`). Batched array bodies use the first entry. Anonymous operations don't match a non-null matcher. Multipart, ReadableStream, or binary bodies emit a diagnostic `applied: false, reason: 'graphql-body-unparseable'` event so users can debug why their rule isn't firing. New `operationName` field on event detail. Builder shortcuts `failGraphQLOperation(name, status, prob)` and `delayGraphQLOperation(name, ms, prob)`. Builder clone now preserves `RegExp` matchers across `.build()` calls. New `/graphql` fixture endpoint on port 8083 (with canned operations + persisted-query support); Playwright (7 specs × 4 browsers = 28), Cypress (6 specs), and Puppeteer (5 specs) E2E coverage. Fast path: when no rule sets `graphqlOperation`, the body extractor is skipped entirely so non-GraphQL apps pay zero cost.
- **Adapter parity + docs (Phase 4 of v0.4.0)**: WDIO now has runtime E2E coverage for SSE and GraphQL operation matching, including RegExp matcher transport, persisted GET, multipart diagnostics, anonymous-query skips, XHR GraphQL, named SSE events, and forced SSE closes. Docs now cover Service Worker chaos, SSE chaos, AI chat streaming under flaky SSE, and failing one GraphQL operation while others pass.

### Changed

- **`@chaos-maker/core` — `globalThis` refactor (Phase 0 of v0.4.0)**: interceptors read their targets (`fetch`, `XMLHttpRequest`, `WebSocket`) through `globalThis` instead of `window`, so the same engine code now runs in both browser page contexts and service worker / worker contexts. No public API change beyond a new optional `ChaosMaker(config, { target })` constructor argument that defaults to `globalThis`.
- UI-config (`config.ui`) is now skipped with a warning (instead of throwing) when no DOM is available in the current context. XHR and WebSocket patching likewise feature-detect before attaching. This is groundwork for v0.4.0 Phase 1 (Service Worker chaos) — no new surface is exposed yet.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added

- **WebdriverIO adapter** (`@chaos-maker/webdriverio`): one-line injection via `injectChaos(browser, config)`, `getChaosLog(browser)`, `getChaosSeed(browser)`, `useChaos(browser, config)`. Embeds the UMD bundle in an injected script tag so Firefox geckodriver still sees the config during initial page load.
  - E2E suite: 49 tests across Chrome and Firefox covering resilience baseline, presets, network/WebSocket/UI chaos, seeded reproducibility, and Nth-request counting.
  - New CI jobs `e2e-webdriverio (chrome)` and `e2e-webdriverio (firefox)`.
- **Puppeteer adapter** (`@chaos-maker/puppeteer`): one-line injection via `injectChaos(page, config)`, `removeChaos(page)`, `getChaosLog(page)`, `getChaosSeed(page)`, `useChaos(page, config)`. Uses `page.evaluateOnNewDocument` to patch `fetch`, `XMLHttpRequest`, and `WebSocket` before any page script runs; tracks init-script identifiers in a `WeakMap<ChaosPage>` so `removeChaos` + repeat `injectChaos` tear down cleanly without stacking.
  - E2E suite: 37 tests on headless Chromium, mirroring the Playwright suite where applicable.
  - New CI job `e2e-puppeteer (headless-new)`.
- **Documentation site** (Starlight-powered, published to GitHub Pages at <https://chaos-maker-dev.github.io/chaos-maker/>): 28 pages covering Install, per-adapter Getting Started, Concepts (chaos types, presets, builder, seeded reproducibility, Nth counting, observability), eight Recipes, API reference, and a Rationale section. Search via Pagefind.
- **Seeded determinism enforcement**: `Math.random` is now an ESLint error across `packages/**` (via `no-restricted-syntax` AST rule, exempt only in `prng.ts`). Every chaos probability decision must flow through `createPrng(seed)` so replays are bit-exact.

### Changed

- `@chaos-maker/core` bumped to 0.3.0 — emits a bit-exact event log for a given seed; any accidental `Math.random` usage now fails CI.
- `@chaos-maker/playwright` bumped to 0.3.0 to pick up core 0.3.0.
- `@chaos-maker/cypress` bumped to 0.3.0 to pick up core 0.3.0.
- Release workflow: new adapters (`webdriverio`, `puppeteer`) publish via classic `NPM_TOKEN` on first release because npm Trusted Publishing requires a pre-existing package. Existing adapters (`core`, `playwright`, `cypress`) continue using OIDC Trusted Publishing.

### Fixed

- **Puppeteer re-injection**: `injectChaos` now removes the prior page's init scripts before registering new ones, preventing double-patching when pages are reused across test cases.
- **Docs site base path**: inline markdown links and hero actions on the Starlight site are now prefixed with `/chaos-maker/` so they resolve under the GitHub Pages base instead of 404ing.
- **Deterministic replay test**: reverted an ill-fitting event-based wait — chaos events are probabilistic so `waitForChaosLogGrowth` could hang when the rolled probability said "no chaos"; reverted to fixed `waitForTimeout` since the seeded PRNG already guarantees reproducibility.

### Security

- Upgraded Astro (4 → 6) and Starlight (0.21 → 0.38) in the docs workspace, clearing 19 transitive CVEs.
- Added `pnpm.overrides` for `diff`, `tar-fs`, `tmp`, `ws`, `serialize-javascript`, `fast-xml-parser` to patch 8 more transitive CVEs across the repo.
- One residual Dependabot alert (`uuid < 14.0.0` via `@cypress/request@3.0.10`) is accepted as tolerable: dev-only transitive, no patched version in range, exploit path (user-controlled `buf` into `v3/v5/v6`) not reachable from Cypress's usage.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added

- **Playwright trace integration** (Phase 5): every applied chaos event now appears inline in the Playwright trace action timeline as a `chaos:<type>` `test.step` entry (e.g. `chaos:network:failure /api/users → 503`). Full event log + PRNG seed attached as `chaos-log.json` on test end.
  - New `InjectChaosOptions` on `injectChaos(page, config, opts)`: `{ tracing: boolean | 'auto', testInfo, traceOptions }`.
  - Fixture auto-enables tracing whenever the project's `use.trace !== 'off'`; opt out per-call with `chaos.inject(config, { tracing: false })`.
  - Bridging via `page.exposeBinding('__chaosMakerReport', …)` + an `addInitScript` subscriber on `chaosUtils.instance.on('*')`. Survives cross-navigation and idempotent per page.
  - New `packages/playwright/src/trace.ts` exports `formatStepTitle`, `shouldEmitStep`, `createTraceReporter`, `ChaosTraceAttachment`, `TraceReporterOptions`.
  - E2E coverage: `e2e-tests/playwright/tests/trace-integration.spec.ts` cracks open the produced `trace.zip` (all four projects: chromium, firefox, webkit, edge) and asserts chaos steps present.
  - Unit coverage: 13 formatter/filter tests under `packages/playwright/test/trace.test.ts`.
- **Cypress adapter coverage** (from rc.1): unchanged — Cypress surfaces chaos via `Cypress.log` (the Command Log), no trace-viewer work needed.

## [0.2.0-rc.1] - 2026-04-17

### Added

- **Cypress adapter** (`@chaos-maker/cypress`): one-line chaos injection via `cy.injectChaos(config)`, `cy.removeChaos()`, `cy.getChaosLog()` custom commands. Ships `@chaos-maker/cypress/support` (auto-registration of commands + `afterEach` cleanup) and `@chaos-maker/cypress/tasks` (plugin-process bridge that reads the UMD bundle from disk).
- **Cypress E2E suite**: 60 tests across 7 spec files in `e2e-tests/cypress/` — full parity with Playwright suite (resilience baseline, chaos lifecycle + presets, network, UI, WebSocket, seeded randomness, Nth-request counting). Runs against Chrome and Electron in CI.
- **CI job `e2e-cypress`**: matrix over `[chrome, electron]` with Cypress binary caching. Firefox is omitted because Cypress 13.x's CDP-over-GeckoDriver bridge is broken against Firefox 140+ (a Cypress-infrastructure issue, not a chaos-maker one); Playwright's `e2e-playwright (firefox)` job covers the Firefox browser engine end-to-end.
- **Release job `publish-cypress`**: publishes `@chaos-maker/cypress` to npm on tagged releases after `publish-core` succeeds.

### Changed

- **E2E layout restructured**: `e2e-tests/` now contains `e2e-tests/{framework}/` subdirectories (`playwright/`, `cypress/`) plus shared `e2e-tests/fixtures/`. Cypress layout flattened to `tests/` + `support/` (overriding Cypress defaults of `cypress/e2e/` + `cypress/support/`) for cross-framework directory symmetry.
- **Package filters renamed**: `e2e-tests` workspace package split into `e2e-tests-playwright` and `e2e-tests-cypress`. Root scripts renamed: `test:e2e` → `test:playwright` + `test:cypress`.
- **CI job renamed**: `e2e-test` → `e2e-playwright` (plus new sibling `e2e-cypress`).
- **Fixture ws-echo-server**: `.js` → `.cjs` to prevent Node treating it as ESM under the root `"type": "module"`.

## [0.2.0-beta.1] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- **WebSocket chaos**: intercept `window.WebSocket` to drop, delay, corrupt, or force-close messages and connections (inbound/outbound/both)
  - Config types: `WebSocketDropConfig`, `WebSocketDelayConfig`, `WebSocketCorruptConfig`, `WebSocketCloseConfig`
  - Corruption strategies: `truncate`, `malformed-json`, `empty`, `wrong-type` (JSON strategies emit `applied: false` with `reason: 'incompatible-payload-type'` for binary frames)
  - Ordering per message: drop → corrupt → delay; close chaos cancels pending per-socket timers so pending delays never fire after close
  - Wrapper preserves `instanceof WebSocket` via prototype aliasing so app code using `instanceof` keeps working
  - New `unreliableWebSocket` preset (10% drop both ways, 500ms inbound delay, 5% inbound truncate)
  - Builder: `.dropMessages()`, `.delayMessages()`, `.corruptMessages()`, `.closeConnection()` + `.dropMessagesOnNth()`, `.delayMessagesOnNth()` shortcuts
  - Emitted events: `websocket:drop`, `websocket:delay`, `websocket:corrupt`, `websocket:close` with `direction`, `payloadType`, `closeCode`, `closeReason`, and `reason` detail fields
- **Per-rule request counting** (Phase 2): `onNth`, `everyNth`, `afterN` on every network and websocket rule — deterministic "fail the 3rd request", "drop every other message"
- **Seeded randomness** (Phase 1): `seed` field on `ChaosConfig`, auto-generated if omitted, exposed via `getChaosSeed(page)` for reproducible chaos runs
- **Playwright adapter**: re-exports `WebSocketConfig`, `WebSocketDropConfig`, `WebSocketDelayConfig`, `WebSocketCorruptConfig`, `WebSocketCloseConfig`, `WebSocketDirection`, `WebSocketCorruptionStrategy`
- **E2E coverage**: WebSocket chaos E2E suite across chromium, firefox, webkit, edge (24 tests) — includes seeded replay determinism, per-message `onNth` counting, close-with-custom-code, truncation, relative-latency baseline

### Removed

- **Chrome extension**: Extracted from monorepo to keep focus on core library and framework adapters

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-03

### Added

- **Network chaos**: failure injection, latency, connection abort, response corruption, CORS simulation
- **UI chaos**: disable, hide, or remove DOM elements by CSS selector via MutationObserver
- **Playwright adapter** (`@chaos-maker/playwright`): `injectChaos`, `removeChaos`, `getChaosLog`, test fixture
- **Config presets**: `unstableApi`, `slowNetwork`, `offlineMode`, `flakyConnection`, `degradedUi`
- **Fluent config builder**: `ChaosConfigBuilder` with chainable methods for all chaos types
- **Event observability**: typed events for every chaos check, wildcard listeners, bounded event log
- **Config validation**: Zod strict mode rejects unknown keys, descriptive error messages
- **CI pipeline**: GitHub Actions with lint, test, build, E2E across Chromium/Firefox/WebKit/Edge
- **Triple format output**: ESM + CJS + UMD for `@chaos-maker/core`

 * Wire the Playwright page ↔ Node bridge that ships chaos events from the
 * in-page emitter into the test runner's trace/report surfaces.
 *
 * Mechanism:
 *   1. `page.exposeBinding(CHAOS_BINDING, handler)` — Playwright-native push
 *      channel (survives navigations).
 *   2. `page.addInitScript(...)` — subscribes `chaosUtils.instance.on('*', …)`
 *      after the core UMD has auto-started. Re-runs on every navigation.
 *
 * On each event, we fire a fire-and-forget `test.step` so the chaos decision
 * appears inline in the Playwright trace action timeline.
 *
 * On `dispose()`, the full event log (including skipped/diagnostic events) is
 * attached to `testInfo` as JSON for programmatic post-mortem.
 *
 * The binding (and matching init script) is registered exactly once per
 * page — `exposeBinding` throws on re-register and Playwright has no remove
 * API. A per-page indirection slot keeps the active reporter swappable so
 * inject → remove → re-inject on the same page works without re-binding.
